# Solar Power Generation ML Project

## Project Overview

### Project Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and predict power generation data from two solar power plants. We aim to:
- Predict power generation.
- Identify the need for panel cleaning or maintenance.

### Dataset Description
This data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34-day period. It consists of two pairs of files - each pair includes one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset. The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level, with each inverter having multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The sensor data is gathered at the plant level, with a single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.
